My personal contributions are:
- HTML, CSS, and JS for one of the main website features â€“ calendar with
dynamically generated days
- JS for keyboard shortcuts feature - in particular the calendar specific commands to
navigate the days or months and years
- Creating team wiki page with Markdown
- Setup the Figma and worked on the dashboard, icons, fonts, and color scheme for
the app
- Helped design our hand-drawn wireframes for desktop and mobile
- Helped revise pitch, cut down feature list, and redesign journal to be more
dev-specific
- Refactored JS code and added unit tests
- Worked on meeting notes, ADRs, and PR reviews
- Worked on brainstorming via Miro: user stories, feature list, and inspirations
